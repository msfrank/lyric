Overview
========

Lyric is a collection of libraries implementing the object and packaging formats,
bytecode interpreter, runtime support, and build system used by the Zuri project.
The intention of this package is to implement the mechanism of the Lyric language
without providing the policy. In more concrete terms, this means that all of the
essential parts of the programming language are present, each with a strongly
defined application programming interface, but the user interface for the language
is defined at a higher layer in a different package.
